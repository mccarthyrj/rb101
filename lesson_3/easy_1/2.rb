# Describe the difference betweeh ! and ? and what will happen in each scenario:
#
#
# what is != and where should you use it? - not equal to, in a conditional
# put ! before something, like !user_name - not, the opposite to return not user_name, depending on value would return true or false 
# put ! after something, like words.uniq! - this indicates the method is destructive, but not always
# put ? before something - ternary operator for if/else, likely in a ternary operation which ? one : two
# put ? after something - on a method name indicating the method works like a conditional
# put !! before something, like !!user_name - not-not, as in the opposite of the opposite and returns the original value without bangs
